# Business Day Planner

## Description

This is a day planner application. Primarily using Jquery/Bootstrap/Javascript.
I built this application because its very helpfull for someone with a busy day.
This solves the problem of forgetting events you have planned for the day.
I learned more about using moment.js for time/date information and formatting, as well as conditional formatting.


## Installation

N/A


## Usage

To use this application open the webpage located here: https://matwll.github.io/business-day-planner 
Then simply click on a time slot and enter an event/appointment/meeting or anything you have going on at that time.
Click the button on the right side of that line and it will lock and save the event.
